            This tool lets you preview the SEO of your website. Simply fill out the form with the title and description of your web page to see how it will look in a browser. You will see colored bars to help you understand if the length is optimal. It is more a question of pixel length than the number of characters. For any in-depth documentation, please refer to Google’s website documentation. Google’s bots may arbitrarily change the title and description depending on the search query.
